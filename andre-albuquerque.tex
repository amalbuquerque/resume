TODO: Biography At the age of seven (1989) Cies wrote his first lines of code in a \acr{LOGO}-like language on an \acr{MSX} (pre-\acr{PC}).  Two years later he attended a conference on an emerging new technology, the Internet, at the Erasmus University from which he would graduate 16 years later (2000) with a degree in Business Computer Science.

After being introduced to the open source movement in 1997, he taught himself a variety of skills including system administration and programming (Bash, Python, Ruby \& \CPP).  By 2002 he got his pet project \acr{KT}urtle ---a zero-entry-barrier programming environment--- included in \acr{KDE}'s \emph{edu} module, and thereby in almost every Linux distribution.

Extensively travelled Europe and Asia after graduating. On return his professional life became a mix of hands-on work in startups and web software agencies, while settling as a husband and father in personal life.
