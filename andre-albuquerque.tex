Had his first contact with computers, a ZX Spectrum+, at the age of three
(1990) and wrote his first lines of code to change the GORILLA.BAS game bundle
with MS-DOS 5, on the 486 computer he got as a birthday present at the age of
nine. Knew from an early age that he wanted to be a computer engineer,
graduated at the age of 22 with a MSc degree in Information Systems and Computer
Engineering from the best engineering school in Portugal.

He is a software engineer at Onfido, after working in the banking industry for
seven years. During this banking detour he obtained a master's degree in
economics. He is currently developing Onfido's microservices using Elixir,
Ruby and Python, learning every day about how applications can thrive
if the correct tools and sound coding practices are applied from the very
beginning.

He recently co-authored a book on Elixir,
\href{https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-elixir}{Mastering
Elixir}, that takes the reader in a journey to develop and deploy on the cloud
a Dropbox-like application.

      \item Created a \href{https://goo.gl/X5bafF}{new \acr{S3} document storage
        microservice}, using Elixir processes to implement a caching mechanism
        and performing the encryption/decryption tasks. Its usage reduced the

      \item Implemented the mechanism in Elixir that calls all the algorithms
        developed in-house and our external providers in parallel and later
        aggregates the different results.
      \item Extracted several provider integrations from our monolith to new
        microservices written in Ruby.
      \item Used an AWS API Gateway + Lambda to create a secure callback
        mechanism, allowing an external provider to asynchronously reply to us.
